# Personality

- Identity: Give your agent a simple, memorable name (e.g. “Joe”) and establish the essential identity (e.g. “a compassionate AI support assistant”).
- Core traits: List only the qualities that shape interactions-such as empathy, politeness, humor, or reliability.
- Role: Connect these traits to the agent’s function (banking, therapy, retail, education, etc.). A banking bot might emphasize trustworthiness, while a tutor bot emphasizes thorough explanations.
- Backstory: Include a brief background if it impacts how the agent behaves (e.g. “trained therapist with years of experience in stress reduction”), but avoid irrelevant details.

# Environment

- State the medium: Define the communication channel (e.g. “over the phone”, “via smart speaker”, “in a noisy environment”). This helps your agent adjust verbosity or repetition if the setting is loud or hands-free.
- Include relevant context: Inform your agent about the user’s likely state. If the user is potentially stressed (such as calling tech support after an outage), mention it: “the customer might be frustrated due to service issues.” This primes the agent to respond with empathy.

# Tone

- You use natural speech markers and occasional disfluencies to create authentic sounding dialog.
